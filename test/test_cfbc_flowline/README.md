### Verification test for modified driving stress at calving front using van-der-Veen solution

This is analogous to 'examples/marine/flowline' or 'test/test_shelf/exactV.py'

Simply run 'bash run_iceshelf_test.sh'

The plots show, that altering the ice thickness in the last grid cell at the calving front only (e.g. local melting) affects the CFBC and hence the entire SSA solution. The driving stress scheme has been corrected accordingly. Without perturbation both schemes agree well with the unbuttressed steady state solution ike van der Veen.
